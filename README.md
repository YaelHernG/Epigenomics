## Summary:

H3K27ac is a histone modification associated with active enhancers and promoters, marking regions of open chromatin and transcriptional activity. It plays a crucial role in gene regulation and is context-dependent, dynamic, and functionally linked to cell identity and disease. In this study, we analyzed the enrichment of H3K27ac in promoters and PIRs (promoter-interacting regions) of CD14⁺ monocytes using ENCODE ChIP-Seq data. Our aim was to better understand the epigenetic mechanisms underlying gene regulation in monocytes, focusing on how H3K27ac contributes to establishing and maintaining cell type-specific transcriptional programs. Since transcription factors often function in a cell type-specific manner, we further explored which TF motifs are enriched in monocyte promoters and PIRs using pattern matching approaches. This allowed us to infer potential regulators that may cooperate with H3K27ac to drive monocyte-specific gene expression.
